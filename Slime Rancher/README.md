# Slime Rancher 1

## Setup

This manual relies on liberal use of the [Slime Rancher Cheat Menu](https://umodframework.com/mod?id=2). Before starting your game, follow the installation instructions for UModFramework and the SR Cheat Menu mod.

It is highly suggested to have the [Slime Rancher Interactive Map](https://mapgenie.io/slime-rancher/maps/far-far-range) open while you play. 

In order to play this manual:

1. Create a new save file
2. Follow the initial tutorial
3. Use SR Cheat Menu to gift yourself 10,000 newbucks
4. Unlock The Lab
5. Follow the tutorial for slime science, giving yourself enough plorts to craft the single novice drill
6. Delete the novice drill from your inventory after completing the tutorial

After this point, you MAY store items in the refinery, but you MAY NOT do anything else in the Lab until you receive the `Ranch Expansion - The Lab`. This includes crafting gadgets, triggering the Hobson's note, or opening the treasure pod.

## What is shuffled?
